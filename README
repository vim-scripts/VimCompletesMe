A super simple, super minimal, super light-weight tab-completion plugin for Vim.

Without configuration, the Tab key will:

    Use Vim's local keyword completion (Ctrl-X_Ctrl-N).
    Complete a file path (Ctrl-X_Ctrl-F)
    Offer omni-completion after typing a period. (Ctrl-X_Ctrl-O)

With a b:vcm_tab_complete variable, the Tab key will complete using:

    Dictionary words (Ctrl-X_Ctrl-K)
    User-defined completion (Ctrl-X_Ctrl-U)
    Tags (Ctrl-X_Ctrl-])
    Vim command line (Ctrl-X_Ctrl-V)

You can set the b:vcm_tab_complete variable interactively, or in an autocommand:

autocmd FileType text,markdown let b:vcm_tab_complete = 'dict'

Striving for minimalism, this plugin weighs under 80 lines of code.
